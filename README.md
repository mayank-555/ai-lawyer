Environment Setup
Using Pipenv
Pipenv is a tool that manages dependencies and virtual environments for Python projects.

Install Pipenv if you don't have it:

pip install pipenv
Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment:

pipenv install
Activate the virtual environment:

pipenv shell
(Optional) Install any additional dependencies:

pipenv install <package_name>
Using Conda
Conda is an open-source package management system and environment management system.

Create a new conda environment:

conda create -n myenv python=3.9
Activate the environment:

conda activate myenv
Install dependencies from requirements.txt (if available):

pip install -r requirements.txt
Using Pip
Pip is the standard package installer for Python.

Install virtualenv if you don't have it:

pip install virtualenv
Create a virtual environment:

virtualenv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies from requirements.txt (if available):

pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Project
The project consists of three Python files, each corresponding to a different phase of the project:

To run the App directly
streamlit run main.py
To run app in different phases
Phase 1: Run the first phase using:

streamlit run frontend.py
Phase 2: Run the second phase using:

python vector_database.py
Phase 3: Run the third phase using:

python rag_pipeline.py
Ensure that all dependencies are installed before running the scripts.
